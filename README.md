Tumor Detection using Machine Learning
This project aims to detect the presence of tumors using machine learning techniques applied to medical data.

✅ Features

Preprocessing of medical data
Correlation matrix analysis to understand feature relationships
Classification model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualizations for insights and performance
📁 Files

Notebook.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook for the tumor detection pipeline
🛠️ How to Run

Install required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb
🔍 Key Steps

Load and explore dataset
Handle missing/non-numeric data
Feature selection and correlation
Train ML model for tumor prediction
Evaluate results with metrics and confusion matrix
📌 Note

This is a beginner-level tumor detection project meant for educational purposes using open datasets. Not for clinical use.
